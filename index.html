			Hi! I was born and raised here in the bay area, making UC Berkeley my dream school ever since I was a kid. Although the midterms and finals are difficult and make me sad, I feel that I’ve learned a lot in all my classes and I’m looking forward to taking more classes that appeal to my interests in the years to come. I intend to major in computer science with intrests in game design, computer security, and AI.

			I am a black belt in MMA, and I’ve taught kids self-defense for ten years. Martial arts is a great passion of mine. I have competed in many tournaments, including the World Championships in Las Vegas. Also, I started a self-defense club in my high school, where we organized performances throughout the year.

			I really enjoy watching and playing sports, especially football (Go Raiders!). Despite being a football enthusiast, my first football game that I attended in person was actually at Cal. I also enjoy trying new restaurants, but I plan on learning how to cook. (Otherwise my parents won’t be happy with my credit card bills). I also like photography and graphic design. Here is a link to my blog!
